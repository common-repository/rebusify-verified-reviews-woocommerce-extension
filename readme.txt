== Description ==
<p>Introducing WooCommerce Reviews for your WooCommerce plugin.</p>
<p>Increase trust, transparency and revenue with real WooCommerce reviews by real customers of your website using WooCommerce and the Trustalyze Confidence System with Blockchain verification built in.</p>
<p>People are searching for your business reviews on your domain name to buy your products or service. Is your company profile page setup? Doing so can increase revenue by 15% or more and our solution is free!</p>
<p>When your customers buy your product or service via WooCommerce using the Trustalyze Confidence System, they have 60 days to leave a 1 through 5-Star review, along with a title and description of the product or service. They can also include a video review with it. Once they save that review, it is immediately ported over to Trustalyze.com where it becomes searchable. And in an industry first, Trustalyze is proud to add the enhanced ability to store WooCommerce reviews on our blockchain, where they become a permanent record impossible to modify. This increases trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Send email reminders to your WooCommerce customers to ask them to leave a review.</p>
<p>When customers buy your product or services you can showcase those product reviews.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is Trustalyze free? =
Yes, Trustalyze is completely free. As a merchant you're allowed 5000 review transactions per month.

= How are the reviews stored on the blockchain? =
We store reviews on our own private blockchain. When a review is posted via the Trustalyze Confidence System, that review is then ported to trustalyze.com where it becomes a searchable record. The review is then posted to the blockchain as a permanent record.

= Is Google indexing Trustalyze Company Profile Pages? =
Yes, right now people are performing domain review searches where they type a domain and the word review and company profile pages of merchants are showing up in the top 10 results. People are searching for your reviews so be sure to get your company profile page setup and start promoting your reviews as well as your company products/services. 

= Should I install the Trustalyze Badge? =
While the Trustalyze Badge is a great way to show your potential customers your reviews, it's best to not show the badge unless you have a few reviews. Get two or three reviews posted to your company profile page then add the Trustalyze Badge to your website via any page or sidebar widget.

= How long do reviews take to be posted to the blockchain? =
Reviews are posted to our blockchain within just a few seconds.
